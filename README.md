# Fire.EXE

A small forest fire "simulation" using the Godot Engine, Tilemap and Particle2D Nodes. I used this to experiment with the GPU Particle system in combination with a Tilemap.

The world is auto-generated randomly on every fresh start and you can ignite a fire by clicking on any grass tile.
